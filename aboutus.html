    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
<div class="textomoss">
    <strong>
        <p>  We are three students from Hyper Island working together in this project. </p>

        <P> Something we found to have in common, became the reason why we developed this website for Sign as Support. It turned out that all 3 of us had experience in working at schools and kindergartens.</P>
        
        <P>
           Our goal is that people who use signs as support and people who want to learn it will find our website helpful. We want to make it as accessible as possible 
            for everyone.  
            </p>

    <h3>What is tecken som stöd?</h3>
        <strong> <p>
            Tecken som stöd is a Swedish simplified sign language.
It's used as support in daily communication with and between children, and people with speech impediments.</p> <p>

Many schools, and parents to children with speech impediments, see the value of teaching everyone sign language as it's a way of communication that makes everyone feel included.
It’s used daily in most kindergartens in Sweden.</p>
<p>
These signs are meant to be a tool to make the spoken language more clear. It makes it easier to learn how to speak, and is a way to communicate even before you can speak.
When you use signs as support, only the most important words in the sentence are signed.</p>
<p>
To stimulate language development, sign as visual support is important.
Signs provide three paths to understanding; what you hear, what you see, and what you feel.
